# PROBLEM STATEMENT

The Play Store apps data has enormous potential to drive app-making businesses to success. Actionable insights can be drawn for developers to work on and capture the Android market. Each app has values for the category, rating, size, and more. Another dataset contains customer reviews of the android apps. I have to explore both datasets to get better insights for apps success.Analysis of Play Store data set and there usr reviews.Google Play was launched on March 6, 2012, bringing together Android Market, and Google under one brand, marking a shift in Google's digital distribution strategy. Mostly user reviews will accompany the ratings to elaborate on how and why they have a positive, negative, or neutral opinion. The user ratings and reviews serve as social proof that helps other users to decide if they want to purchase a product, install the app, use a service, etc.
